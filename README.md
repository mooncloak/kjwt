### Repository

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/mooncloak/public")
}
```

### Dependencies

```kotlin
implementation("com.mooncloak.kodetools.kjwt:kjwt-core:VERSION")
```

## Usage

The following library usage examples, and more, can be found in the [sample module](sample).

### Creating a JWT (Signed JWS)

The following example illustrates how to create a [CompactedJwt](docs/). The full source code can be
found [here](sample/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mooncloak/kodetools/kjwt/sample/CreateJwt.kt).

```kotlin
Jwt {
    header {
        signatureAlgorithm = algorithm
        keyId = "MY_KEY_ID"
        // ...
    }

    payload {
        this.issuedAt = Clock.System.now()
        this["custom_claim"] = JsonPrimitive("CUSTOM_CLAIM_VALUE")
        this.putValue(key = "other_custom_claim", value = 0)
        // ...
    }
}.sign(
    resolver = keyResolver,
    algorithm = algorithm
).compact()
```

### Parsing a compacted JWS

The following example illustrates how to parse a [CompactedJwt](docs/). The full source code can be
found [here](sample/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mooncloak/kodetools/kjwt/sample/ParseCompactedJwt.kt).

```kotlin
val (header, payload, signature) = Jws.parse(
    compacted = compactedJwt,
    resolver = keyResolver
)
```

### JSON Web Keys (JWKs and JWKSets)

JWKs are used to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt JWTs. They are essential for working with JWTs
and it is up to an application to define where it obtains its JWKs. This library
provides [Jwk](docs/kjwt-core/kjwt-core/com.mooncloak.kodetools.kjwt.core.key/-jwk/index.md)
and [JwkSet](docs/kjwt-core/kjwt-core/com.mooncloak.kodetools.kjwt.core.key/-jwkset/index.md)
components, as well as
a [KeyResolver](docs/kjwt-core/kjwt-core/com.mooncloak.kodetools.kjwt.core.key/-key-resolver/index.md)
component which is used to obtain a JWK.

#### Creating a JWK

To create a JSON Web Key, use the [Jwk.invoke] constructor function:

```kotlin
Jwk(keyType = KeyType.RSA) {
    keyId = "abc123"
    signatureAlgorithm = SignatureAlgorithm.HS256
    keyOperations = listOf(KeyOperation.Sign, KeyOperation.Verify)
    use = KeyUse.Sig
    // ...
}
```

The full source code can be
found [here](sample/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mooncloak/kodetools/kjwt/sample/CreateJwk.kt)
